# Computer Graphics Introduction

## What was done since the final presentation
All the bullet points on the *To Do* list of the final presentation were completed. The following is a list of the changes made since the final presentation:
-   **Limit number of throws**: Each game session now has a limit of 2 throws.
-   **Informative messages**: A box appears on the screen with the messages "Game Over" or "You won" when the game ends either for not having more throws or winning. There is a button restart that allows the player to restart the game by going back to the initial page.

## Deliverables
Both the **video** and the **final presentation** are available in the `deliverables` folder.

## Project Overview

This is a project developed in **Three.js** for the Computer Graphics Introduction course at the University of Aveiro.

We had total freedom to choose the theme we wanted to develop, so I chose to develop a **Bowling Game**.
